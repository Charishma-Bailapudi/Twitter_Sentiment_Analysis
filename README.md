# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis

It is no longer difficult to understand what people think about a topic by analysing the tweets shared by people. Sentiment analysis is one of the most popular use cases for NLP (Natural Language Processing).

Here,I am going to use “Tweepy,” which is an easy-to-use Python library for accessing the Twitter API. You need to have a Twitter developer account and sample codes to do this analysis. You can find the Colab Notebook code in my Github Repository.

## *Step 1: Install and Import Libraries*
Before analysis, you need to install textblob and tweepy libraries using !pip install command on your Colab Notebook.
```
# Install Libraries
!pip install textblob
!pip install tweepy

```
